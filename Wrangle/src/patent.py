# This and the following exercise are using US Patent database.
# The patent.data file is a small excerpt of a much larger datafile
# that is available for download from US Patent website. They are pretty large ( >100 MB each).
# The data itself is in XML, however there is a problem with how it's formatted.
# Please run this script and observe the error. Then find the line that is causing the error.
# You can do that by just looking at the datafile in the web UI, or programmatically.
# For quiz purposes it does not matter, but as an exercise we suggest that you try to do it programmatically.
# The original file is ~600MB large, you might not be able to open it in a text editor.

# So, the problem is that the gigantic file is actually not a valid XML, because
# it has several root elements, and XML declarations.
# It is, a matter of fact, a collection of a lot of concatenated XML documents.
# So, one solution would be to split the file into separate documents,
# so that you can process the resulting files as valid XML documents.
